Description: High performance variant of apply() for a fixed set of functions.
  Considerable speedup is a trade-off for universality, user defined
  functions cannot be used with arrApply. However, 20 most currently employed
  functions are available for usage. They can be divided in three types:
  reducing functions (like mean(), sum() etc., giving a scalar when applied to a vector),
  mapping function (like normalise(), cumsum() etc., giving a vector of the same length
  as the input vector) and finally, vecor reducing function (like diff() who produces
  a result vector of a length different from the length of input vector).
  Optional or mandatory additional arguments required by some functions can be
  passed as named arguments in '...'.
